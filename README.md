# Haskell-Checkers

Simple haskell checkers program built using cabal. The AI for the checkers can be found in the ABSsearch.hs file, which was built using a min-max tree with alpha-beta pruning. The heuristic for the ai can be found in the Heuristic.hs file.

Run the file Main.hs to watch the black ai and red ai play against each other in a command line game of checkers.
